By downloading and using the program you are acknowledging the fact that you agree to 
the terms of the agreement. If do not agree with all terms and conditions of the agreement, 
you may not download, install nor use the program.  

The User of the LGA program shall be bound by the following terms and conditions:

1) The User will receive the LGA program and any related documentation in confidence and will 
use the program for the purpose of his/her own research.

2) The LGA program should be used at only one location by authorized users. 

3) The User agrees to acknowledge the Author in any publication based in part on results 
produced by the LGA program or any of its implemented algorithms or measures (e.g. LCS, GDT, GDC). 
The publication should include the following primary citation:

   Research, Vol. 31, No. 13, 2003, pp. 3370-3374.
   
Additional citations in case of referencing some specifics in LCS, GDT, and GDC measures 
(e.g.: LCS or GDT plots), or selection of point position within residues to represent protein 
backbone for structure superposition calculations (e.g. options: "-atom","-bmo", and "-cb"):

4) If any modifications to the LGA program are introduced, or any portion of the provided LGA 
software is incorporated into other programs these should be communicated to the Author and any 
publications that result from the modifications should include the appropriate citation to the 
original publication as mentioned in paragraph 3. 

5) The LGA program or any of its components should not be copied, distributed, transferred in 
any form (internet transfer, discs, hard copies... ) nor sublicensed. The program or its parts 
cannot be sold or incorporated into a commercial software. 

6) The results of research obtained by using the LGA program should not be incorporated into 
any data banks that are subject to license fees or any other payments.

7) The User understands that the LGA program is provided "as is," and no warranty is issued. 
The Author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the use of the LGA program.



Thank you for accepting and respecting all terms and conditions of this agreement.
